Out of the box, containers can send requests to the World Wide Web.
You can communicate with web API's and web pages from inside your dockerized applications.
You don't need any special setup or any changes to your code, this code just works.
Sending this HTTP request from inside the dockerized application works.
It works just as it worked without containers and without Docker.

You need to replace local hosts with a special domain, which is understood by Docker and that's host.docker.internal.
This special domain is recognized by Docker. It's understood by Docker.
And it's translated to the IP address off your host machine as seen from inside the Docker container.
And you can use this anywhere where you need a domain, where you need a URL.

Communication between containers can be maid if we inspect a container and find its ip address and use the ip address
in the other container.

Create networks using
docker network create favorites-net
docker run -d --name mongodb --network favourites-net mongo

If two containers are part of the same network, you can just put the other containers instead of the ip address.
